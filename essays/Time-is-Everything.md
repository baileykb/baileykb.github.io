  - Design Patterns
---
<p>	Until recently, I had no idea what a “Design pattern” was. A design pattern is a general reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem. For someone like me, who is rather new to the computer science/programming world, design patterns are a lifesaver. I’m able to gather all of the knowledge/simple solutions of problems that my predecessors already essentially mastered. This is why design patterns are crucial to the learning/teaching process of new students. New students won’t have to go through the endless hours of self-teaching/learning that their predecessors went through. This enables them to gain this knowledge much more efficiently. This efficiency is what helps advance humanity as a whole. This is why computer science or even just technology, in general, has been able to advance as fast as it has. I can’t even imagine how learning anything computer/computer science related would be like if I took a computer science related course 20-30 years ago. In general,  learning about any subject that is still in its infancy is rather complicated.

<p>Throughout this semester I didn't even realize how often I have been using design patterns in my code. Design patterns are one of those things that you don't even realize you're doing until it's pointed out to you. Because I was taught to use theese patterns, I generally just believed this was how you code. I didn't appreciate all the hardwork, time and effort my predecesors put into creating easy, and understandable ways to simplify the process of coding. Now that I know a little bit about design patterns, I'm going to try and actively use this knowledge in future ICS, and personal projects. I believe this will be a very important step on improving my coding skills, and hopefully when I look back this essay my knowledge on design patterns will have increased by a great amount.</p>
