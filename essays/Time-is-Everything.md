<h2>Time is Everything</h2>

<p>	Until recently, I had no idea what a “Design pattern” was. A design pattern is a general reusable solution to a common occurring problem. For someone like me, who is rather new to the computer science/programming world, design patterns are a lifesaver. I’m able to gather all of the knowledge/simple solutions of problems that my predecessors already essentially mastered. This is why design patterns are crucial to the learning/teaching process of new students. New students won’t have to go through the endless hours of self-teaching/learning that their predecessors went through. This enables them to gain this knowledge much more efficiently. This efficiency is what helps advance humanity as a whole. This is why computer science or even just technology in general has been able to advance as fast as it has. I can’t even imagine how learning anything computer/computer science related would be like if I were took a computer science related course 20-30 years ago. Learning anything that is still in its infancy is very complicated.
