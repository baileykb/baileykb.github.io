<h2>Why Semantic UI is Superior</h2>

<p>Semantic UI is a modern front-end development framework. Many developers use this framework to simplify the agonizing web design/formatting process that comes with using raw HTML and CSS. Semantic UI also utilizes human words or phrases to simplify things. Phrases such as “ui grid”, or “four wide column” are commonly used. This human-like way of writing makes it very easy for the user to understand. Semantic UI’s ability to provide a wide variety of classes, icons, symbols, functions and many other things allow the user to be very flexible. This is because it is one of the most fully featured frameworks out there. It’s also the main reason why Semantic UI is so popular among developers.</p>

<h2> Personal Experience </h2>
<p>My experience with Semantic UI so far has been rather pleasant. Although I have only recreated the design of what certain websites look like, the basic understanding I have now has shown that I have the tools to somewhat mimic what top-level web designers are making. I definitely don’t have the ability to do what they do from scratch but it is very satisfying to know that what they have made can be done by a beginner like me. Practice makes perfect and I’m sure in the years to come when my knowledge of Semantic UI is not limited to a week’s worth of lecture, and online material my abilities will improve dramatically. If I have learned anything so far this semester it would be to seriously take the time to master a front-end development framework. It will make your life a lot easier. I plan on sticking with Semantic UI for the time being, but I’m also going to try out other frameworks such as bootstrap. It never hurts to broaden your horizons.  </p>

<h2> Don’t Overcomplicate! </h2>
<p>The human-like language that Semantic UI implements is definitely my favorite part about learning the framework so far. After learning how languages such as Java utilize complicated phrases or keywords, it was an awesome experience to be able to read/write code in my own language(English). Semantic UI  is a very good example of why developers don’t need to make their language so complicated. I hope other developers pick up on this and apply it to their frameworks, or languages in the future so it can be more user/learning friendly for everyone. </p>
