summary: In my ICS 211 class we created a project that incorporated binary and linear search to find an integer given by the user.

This project was made in my ICS 211, Spring 2018. The program was written in Java through Eclipse, and we had around 2 weeks to come up with a search engine that implements both algorithms mentioned in the summary. The main idea of this project was to put together all the little assignments we had done over the semester into one big project. The program generated a list of 20 random integers between 1-1000. From the menu printed out in the console, the user was able to: Display a list of integers, sort the list of integers given, sort for an integer, search for an integer, and save the list to an external file.  

In this project I gained a lot of experience with Java, Eclipse, time management skills, and problem solving. We were given only a short amount of time and the project was worth a lot of our grade so it was very important for me to stay on task and get started right away. This was also important because while I did have a general grasp of what I needed to do for the project, I ended up running into a lot of problems towards the end. Giving myself this extra time to completet the assignment helped a lot in reducing the amount of stress that normally occurs towards the end of the semester.
