summary: I created a library checkout program in my ICS 111 class .
---
This project was about creating a identical program to a classic library checkout system. I was responsible for creating the entire project in around 2 weeks. The user was able to check in books, and check out books. The program let the user know how long the user had until they needed to return the book, and let them know if it was overdue when they returned it. The program also stored the time/date of the books that were checked out, and the time/date of when they were checked back in. 

The library checkout program I created in my ICS 111 class taught me how/when to use classes in Java efficiently, how to call and create methods, and how to use arrays effectively. I also learned about the struggles other programmers go through who are self taught because this class was held online. Not having the Professor there to help you through your problems in person, and having to email them for help was a nightmare. I spent a lot of nights waiting for my Professor to point me in the right direction because I could not find a solution. This project/class introduced me to the world of Computer Science andd although there were a lot of struggles along the way I soon found myself to be very interested with the material.
