summary: My team developed a robot that could drive around a course to collect and stack crates.
---

This was the first big project that I have been a part of. I had no idea how much time, work and effort it took to build a robot for these competitions. This was a very important project for me personally because it helped me further develop my teamworking skills, and having the ability to finish something when a deadline is given. 
For this project I was a part of a team of five people, and our goal was to build a course that would simulate the real thing. We first built a ramp in the woodshop that our robot would need to scale in order to get to the crates. This simple task took us around a week of staying late in the woodshop. After we completed this task the next thing we did was setup a test course that our robot would have to complete in order to get the crates.
