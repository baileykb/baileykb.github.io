summary: My team developed a robot that could drive around a course to collect and stack crates.
---
For this project I was a part of a team of five people, and our goal was to build a course that would simulate the real thing. We first built a ramp in the woodshop that our robot would need to scale in order to get to the crates. After we completed this task the next thing we did was setup a test course that our robot would have to complete in order to get the crates. Our group completed our task a lot sooner than we were expected to so we were then tasked with just providing as much assistance as we could to the other team members. I personally helped with the brainstorming of how we want our robot to perform the tasks we were given for thhe competition and the assembly of the robot.   

This was the first big project that I have been a part of. I had no idea how much time, work and effort it took to build a robot for these competitions. This was a very important project for me personally because it helped me further develop my teamworking skills, and having the ability to finish something when a deadline is given.
